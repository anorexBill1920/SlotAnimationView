# Documentation: SlotAnimationView and InfiniteScroller
## Overview
SlotAnimationView is a SwiftUI view that displays a list of items in a slot machine-like animation. It leverages the InfiniteScroller view to achieve the infinite scrolling effect.

## Requirements
iOS 14.0+
SwiftUI

## Installation
Ensure you have both SlotAnimationView and InfiniteScroller structs in your project.

## Usage
SlotAnimationView
swift
Copy code

<pre>
SlotAnimationView(items: yourItemsArray, restartAnimation: .constant(true)) { item in
    // Your custom view for each item
    Text(item.name) // Example
}
</pre>

## Parameters:

items: An array of items that conform to Identifiable and Hashable.
restartAnimation: A binding to a boolean that determines whether the animation should restart.
content: A closure that returns the view for each item.
InfiniteScroller
This is an internal view used by SlotAnimationView to achieve the infinite scrolling effect. You typically won't need to use this directly unless you have custom requirements.

## Customization
You can customize the appearance of each item in the SlotAnimationView by modifying the content closure.
